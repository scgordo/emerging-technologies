      <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
        </p>

        <p>Node is designed to build scalable network applications. Many connections can be handled concurrently, as it is an asynchronous even driven runtime. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node. In contrast, thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and difficult to use.
        </p>

        <p>Users don't have to wait for blocking processes to complete any non-JavaScript functions; rather they continue to work in the background, while your Node project continues to run. Thus, non-blocking operations are more efficient.

      <h2>Learn</h2>
        <p>Taking a quick look at two free online resources, any junior level developer can learn how to get a Node application off the ground. I will demonstrate this by going through two tutorials:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/" target="_blank">w3schools Hello World Tutorial</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XF6AFGqlc" target="_blank">Node.js (video) Tutorial For Absolute Beginners</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Just through these resources, an aspiring Node.js developer can learn what Node is, how to set up the environment, and how to run a Node environment with some very simple code to see it in action. It won't be anything fancy, but the point is to set up an environment that can then hold a real network application.
